# Puppy Activity Tracker - Supabase Upgrade

This document outlines the upgrade from localStorage to Supabase for the Puppy Activity Tracker app.

## 🚀 What's New

The app has been completely upgraded from using localStorage to a full Supabase backend with:

- **Real Authentication** - Email/password authentication with Supabase Auth
- **Cloud Database** - PostgreSQL database with Supabase
- **Real-time Sync** - Activities sync across devices in real-time
- **Secure Data** - Row-level security ensuring users only see their own data
- **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript integration with generated types

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### Before (localStorage)
```
📱 App ↔️ localStorage (browser only)
```

### After (Supabase)
```
📱 App ↔️ Supabase Auth ↔️ PostgreSQL Database
              ↕️
         Row Level Security
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### Users Table
- Automatically created when users sign up
- Stores user profile and puppy information
- Links to Supabase Auth system

### Activities Table
- All puppy activities with timestamps
- Supports notes and photo URLs
- Proper foreign key relationships

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)** - Users can only access their own data
2. **Email Verification** - Users must verify their email before accessing the app
3. **Secure Authentication** - Powered by Supabase Auth
4. **Type-safe Operations** - All database operations are type-checked

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### New Dependencies
- `@supabase/supabase-js` - Main Supabase client
- `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` - Next.js auth helpers
- `@radix-ui/react-dialog` - Dialog components

### New Components & Hooks
- `AuthProvider` - Manages authentication state
- `useActivities` - Custom hook for activity management
- Database types with full TypeScript support

### Authentication Flow
1. User signs up with email/password + profile info
2. Confirmation email sent via Supabase
3. User confirms email and can sign in
4. Profile automatically created in database
5. All activities are tied to authenticated user
